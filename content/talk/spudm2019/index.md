abstract: We study the flood risk misperceptions of floodplain residents in the Netherlands. We examine how  perceptions of flood probability and damage relate to objective risk information in a lab-in-the-field experiment. We relate these to self-reported coping responses, worry and trust. <br><br> I will present in het poster session on Wednesday from 14.30 to 17.00 in the A hall of UvA REC A (Nieuwe Achtergracht 166).
