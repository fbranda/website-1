<h3> Changing diets - The role of motivations, knowledge and `foodprint' information for sustainable dietary choices </h3> 
With [Meike Morren](https://www.meikemorren.com/), [Julia Blasch](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/julia-blasch) and [&#381;iga Malek](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/%C5%BEiga-malek). 

<b>Abstract:</b>
In the coming decades, a shift to healthier and more sustainable diets could provide food security and reduce the pressure on the environment. Yet, research has shown that many consumers have misconceptions about the environmental impact of food products as well as about what constitutes a healthy diet. A scoping study aimed to understand the misconceptions regarding the sustainability of food products and their motivations to adopt alternative diets. Subsequently, an intervention study in a large representative sample allowed us to test the impact of providing information about the environmental or health impact of dietary choices versus suggestions of more sustainable or healthier meals. \hl{We show that knowledge about sustainable or healthy diets does not relate to the dietary choices. Additionally, those who received meal suggestions make more sustainable food choices compared to those who received information about impact. The effect is larger when treating health instead of environmental impact.} Based on our results, policy interventions could be designed to stimulate more sustainable diets by this important group of consumers.
